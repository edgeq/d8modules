# Drupal Modules
> Here lies a collection of Drupal 8 modules worth exploraing. 
> 

The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of what drupal modules are, how to install using composer, and give a basic idea of what kind of functionality these modules add to a basic drupal instance. Each module is listed with it's machine name for reference when installing via the command line *(recommended)*

## module_filter
	composer require drupal/module_filter
	
[Module Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/module_filter): quickly find the module you are looking for without having to rely on the browsers search feature... *why isn't this core?*

## webform 
	composer require drupal/webform

[Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform): Webform is the module for making forms and surveys in Drupal. After a submission customizable e-mails can be sent to administrators and/or submitters. Results can be exported into Excel or other spreadsheet applications. Webform also provides some basic statistical review and has an extensive API for expanding its features.

This is a robust and actively maintained module. It's heavy and opinionated, but sometimes that's ok!
